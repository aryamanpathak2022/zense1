## Exercise-10 Structures, Sorting, File-IO, Code design and documentation
    This excercise will help us to get familiar with the process of:
    -File input-output,
    -Making structures,
    -Making an array of structures,
    -Sorting data and
    -Displaying the sorted data in a text file.

## Files required ot be downloaded beforehand:
1. [input_file](https://github.com/Sanchit-Kumar-Dogra/zense-stuff/blob/main/input_file)
2. [lab10.c](https://github.com/Sanchit-Kumar-Dogra/zense-stuff/blob/main/lab10.c)
## Explaining the mechanism of the code
    1) sort() function sort the given array of structures based on id of students in the array.
        The sorting method used is Bubble sorting.
        It works by examining each set of adjacent elements in the array
        From left to right,
        Switching their positions if they are out of order.
## How to Run files
    1) First install the files as mentioned above in same directory
    2) Open the terminal
    3) gcc Structure.c 
    4) ./a.out 
    5) To view ouput_file type    cat ouput_file.txt
